# Bossnnections - Connections in Python

This is an imitation of the fan-favorite New York Times Game Connections, coded through a Python format. This was created for my Yr 11 Software Engineering Assessment.


## How to Play
You will be Displayed with a 4x4 grid, populated with 16 words that fit into 4 categories. Your Objective is to guess which 4 words fit into the same category. Once you have gussed a category correct it will be floated to the top and highligted as correct, and if you are incorrect one life will be deducted from the 4 you have at the start of each game. Once you have guessed all categories correctly their is a win message and replay feature.
## Installation
You install BOSSNNECTIONS by cloing the repository

-Once you have clone the repository, you will need to find it in a Python interpeter and then run it
